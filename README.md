# MOSTLY QA code challenge

## Description
This project contains technical code challenge for QA Engineer interview. Implementation made with `Cypress` by 'Michal Kmiecik'.

The files and folders are structured already and the `spec` files already contain skeleton code with **fill-in areas** (marked with `// type your code here...`), where the challenge's solution is expected to be filled in.

Each exercise/question has a difficulty level marker from the following list: 1️⃣ | 2️⃣ | 3️⃣ | 4️⃣ 
✨ Tricky or extra (harder) questions are marked with this symbol.

While providing implementations, please fill in the right place in the code (or at least try).
